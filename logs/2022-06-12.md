Log #17 | 2022-06-12-19:22 | Fix delay not being applied in acs

When setting a delay for running a command in auto clock speed if you set the delay to the default 1000ms then the delay when the computer is on battery would have remained the same. I fixed this by converting the delay and battery_delay parameters to an option, this allows the program to detect if the parameters were actually set. Previously in order to check if the parameter was set I checked to make sure the user specified anything other than the default value, so when the user wanted to force the default value, battery_delay didn't get changed because it couldn't tell that the user overwrote the value.
