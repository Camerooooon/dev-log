Log #1 | 2022-05-16-18:45 | Created dev-log application

Today I created a program that allows me to automatically upload programming logs to the internet. My plan for this is to set up a script to automatically download these logs to my web server where they will be hosted publicly. The purpose of this application is to keep me up to date on programming so I can get into a consistent schedule. I plan on making no less then 7 logs a week.
