Auto clock speed was not responding to the delay argument. The reason was that auto clock speed wasn't actually updating the effective delay time each tick so they fact that the computer is charging didn't get passed to the sleep method and the delay was constantly using the battery delay. This issue actually resolves a large problem which was that delay itself didn't update (for example if you start acs with the computer plugged in the delay will be 1000ms but when you unplug during runtime it wont change to 5000ms). This took me a while to debug because the root cause was very unexpected. In the end the PR is 16 line difference for such a big fix!
