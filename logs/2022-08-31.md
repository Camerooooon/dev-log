Today at Citrus Circuits I recovered data from a hard drive with errors which caused it to not be bootable. I used an arch iso to boot into the computer and mounted the drive to recover the data. Once I got the data off the drive I moved it to a flash drive. The total repair took about 40 minutes not including the time it took to create the bootable USB and the time it took to transfer the files after recovery.
