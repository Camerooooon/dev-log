Today I completely disassembled my laptop and rebuilt it from the ground up with a new keyboard. My previous keyboard had keys such as the R key that would refuse to work. I replaced the keyboard entirely with a new one. Although this was not programming related it was a technical journey for me. My Dell XPS 9360 is not easy to work in and I learned a lot of techniques from this experience. I ended up losing 2 screws unfortunately, however I will order new ones from amazon. I strategically positioned the missing screws in a spot such that they are very easy to replace. The two screws I lost was 1x M2x3, Torx for the exterior of the case and 1x M1.6x1.5 for the keyboard. After the repair I managed to type 126 WPM with 98% accuracy on monkey type which is incredibly considering it is a laptop keyboard.
