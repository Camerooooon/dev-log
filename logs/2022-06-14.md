Log #20 | 2022-06-14-10:07 | Add graph type display for acs

I made it so that auto clock speed will now display the current graph type when graphing as a reminder to the user of which graph mode they are using.

Log #21 | 2022-06-14-21:26 | Mine Sweeper

I decided to attempt to code mine sweeper in Rust. I did this as learning experience and I managed to get the game fully functional. There are still many features that I would like to add such as colors, a victory screen, and automatic mine clearing for all of the zeros at the start of the game.
