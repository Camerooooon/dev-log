Today I installed a buzzer into my home server. I reused an old buzzer and soldered it to a pin header then plugged it into my server. I ran into some issues with permissions and in descriptive errors however I eventually got it working. The goal of this buzzer will be to have a physical alarm when a raid array fails.
