Log #8 | 2022-05-25-00:10 | Buzzer installation on home server

Today I installed a buzzer into my home server. I reused an old buzzer and soldered it to a pin header then plugged it into my server. I ran into some issues with permissions and in descriptive errors however I eventually got it working. The goal of this buzzer will be to have a physical alarm when a raid array fails.

I added the ability to see the individual core usage in acs monit in auto clock speed. My absolute favorite part about this task was setting colors for cpu usage. It is very satisfying to see the colors go red when I start performing a heavy task. Overall I really enjoyed implementing this feature.
