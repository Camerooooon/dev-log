Today I created a new route for the rclc discovery server. The route adds the ability to get information about the discovery server this will make it possible for clients to present information to the user about the server. The info route also contains extra data like an motd and whether or not the server is current accepting requests. Perhaps in the future we could add a feature to stop the server from accepting requests while keeping the application running. Like an admin dashboard which contains information like handled requests and more.
