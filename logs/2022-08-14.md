I decided that I wanted to keep the logic for calculating the next dosage on the server side because I was to ensure that my multiple front ends are kept on the same page. I created a more complicated return type for the /lastdose route which contains a formatted timestamp of the last dose and a insulin time boolean that shows when it has been more than 24 hours since the last dose.
