Log #26 | 2022-06-26-13:23 | Multithreading safely in auto clock speed

The method that we utilized for connecting out acs client with the acs daemon was to utilize a unix daemon sock. The problem is handling connection asynchronously to the main daemon thread. Because the main thread and the thread used for handling sock connections are async they may run into an issue where they try to access data at the same time. The solution that I decided to use was to replace most of the references to the `Daemon` with references to an `Arc<Mutex<Daemon>>` which is what I would say is a "wrapper struct" that "surrounds" the daemon. This struct controls which thread is allowed to read and write to the object (in this case the daemon). A thread can request to read/write data by performing a "lock" on the data which basically says to whatever thread is requesting the data that it needs to wait for the main thread to stop using the data (in this case if the main thread is utilizing the data the socket thread will wait for the request to finish before proceeding thereby holding up the socket thread which is not a problem since our acs client can be patient). I learned so much about multithreading throughout the few days it took me solve this issue and I'm so glad I took the challenge to implemented multithreading instead of simply handling connections between daemon timeout.
