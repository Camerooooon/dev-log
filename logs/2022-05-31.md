Log #10 | 2022-05-31-14:24 | Refactor ACS rules code

I actually did this yesterday and I'm writing the log for it today. I re-wrote the code for switching between rules in auto clock speed. We previously had multiple checks for each rule which lead to rules overwriting other rules. This resulted in a messy unmaintainable, and occasionally bug prone system for switching the governor. I refactored it by switching to a state machine based system which allowed the code to be a lot easier to understand. I basically defined an enum for each different state the system could be in, that being Normal, LowPower, LidClosed, HighCpuUsage or Charging then based off system data (like lid state, battery percent etc) I would switch between these states. Then finally apply the governor based on the state. Previously we had complicated logic for making sure certain rules don't overwrite each other. For example, when the lid was closed it should be set to powersave but occasionally it would be overwritten by the computer charging resulting in the incorrect governor being set. Overall this refactor brought the line count down by a staggering 150 lines while maintaining the same functionality and improving readability substantially. I will be revisiting this log later today to further reflect however I am out of time now and there is more to be said.
