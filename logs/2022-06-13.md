Log #18 | 2022-06-13-19:36 | Fix cpu tests in auto clock speed

The main branch was failing tests! The problem was that init_cpu was not getting called upon the cpu by the list_cpus() function. This meant that the cpu never actually grabbed the static data like min and max frequency.

Log #19 | 2022-06-13-20:16 | Rust doesn't have runtime test skippign

For some reason in rust lang it is impossible to "cancel" or "skip" a test at runtime. Tests are on a pass or fail basis. This means that our tests that need to be ran without sudo will need to be forced to pass despite not actually being ran. This issue has been open for a while at: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/68007 however it has not been implemented yet. I also found this thread about the matter: https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-skippable-tests/14611/27 suggesting the feature. Finally, I found this blog post: https://plume.benboeckel.net/~/JustAnotherBlog/skipping-tests-in-rust/ which confirmed that it is indeed impossible to skip a test. The worst part about all of this, I can't even print to the user that the test wasn't ran because it's impossible to send a message to the user within a test. Anyway my implementation can be found at https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/auto-clock-speed/pull/334
