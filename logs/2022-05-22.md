Log #7 | 2022-05-22-19:56 | Auto clock speed cpu usage implementation

Today I translated the bash script that I found yesterday into rust code for auto clock speed. I learn a lot about parsing strings which is something I have avoided in the past with rust. This was a good experience not just for learning rust code but I also learned a few things about bash. The script that I was using had a rather cursed implementation of summation of multiple space separated numbers, ex: 63 21 5512. What the script did was replace all white space with the + character then evaluate the string thus producing the sum of the number.
