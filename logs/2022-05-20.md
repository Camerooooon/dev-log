Log #5 | 2022-05-20-22:05 | Fixed temperature readings on my home server

I just moved my home server to an enclosed box. I decided it would be appropriate to start logging the temperate of the computer in order to make sure nothing breaks. I fixed this by detecting the proper kernel module using the sensors application. I then loaded this kernel module and made it load on boot. The temperature now reads when I use the sensors command however it does not log yet.
