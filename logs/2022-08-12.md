Log #31 | 2022-08-12-21:33 | DiscoveryResponse parsing for rclc

Our daemon was taking raw String json data from the discovery server however it wasn't parsing it into a usable struct. This PR uses serde to convert that JSON into an actual usable structure. It also adds a Contact implementation from future usage. A Contact will be able to be generated in multiple different ways, for example; being loaded from a toml file.
