Log #29 | 2022-08-09-23:37 | First progress on building peer discovery system from rclc

Today I made the parsing system for the "discover" route for rclc. The idea is that clients send their user identification, public key, and IP address to the discovery server and it pairs them up with another client of their choosing (based on client ID). This then connect the two peers, along with their public keys, to each other which allows them to communicate. What I wrote was the basic parser which takes the web request and converts it safely into a struct for further use.

One problem that I had creating this system was ip addresses not being fulfilled during unit tests. This caused the system to force a redirect which made testing not work. I fixed this by surrounding the IP address field with an Option which I believe could be improved, however it may work for the foreseeable future.
