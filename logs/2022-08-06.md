Log #28 | 2022-08-06-16:36 | Fix up auto clock speed main branch

Auto clock speed was failing to launch the daemon on my computer due to some unwrap methods not handling errors properly. This in addition to the daemon attempting to hook into the server when the server isn't running caused our main branch the not work! I fixed these two issues in https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/auto-clock-speed/pull/384 by adding a --hook argument and improving error handling.
