Today I made auto clock speed have a longer delay when the computer is not connected to power. This saves battery because the computer is automatically making the decision to take longer between checking. The default timeout is 1000ms between checks however when the computer is on battery is goes up to 5000ms. This closes an issue.

Log #4 | 2022-05-17-17:59 | Clean up dev-log repository

I removed the "count" file from the remote repository to clean it up a bit and added it to the gitignore file. I also added some more instructions to the README.md in order to instruct other people to recreate that file before running the script. Otherwise the script will not work because it is missing the count file. I was thinking of automatically generating that file if it wasn't detected however that is a lot of effort for something that is one and done for the end user.
