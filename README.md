**I have switch to a different system for taking daily notes**

This repository contains my logs for all my programming advancements. I hope I can keep make a log every single day. To use this script modify the `LOGS_DIRECTORY` variable to your desired directory, then create a file in there named `count` and set the contents to `0`, this will keep track of how many logs there are.
